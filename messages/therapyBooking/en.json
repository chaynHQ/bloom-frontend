      "faqTitle0": "Who is the Bloom for Bumble programme for?",
      "faqBody0": "The programme is available to any Bumble user who reports sexual abuse or assault to Bumble, regardless of your background, race, age, disability, religion or belief, sexuality, gender identity or expression, or life circumstances – we are here for you.",
      "faqTitle1": "Do I have to pay for therapy?",
      "faqBody1": "No, you can access the Bloom for Bumble programme for free.",
      "faqTitle2": "How many therapy sessions do I get?",
      "faqBody2": "Six, 50 minute therapy sessions.",
      "faqTitle3": "How much time do I have to book my therapy sessions?",
      "faqBody3": "You can choose how often you want to have your sessions, whether it's once a week or once a month. We recommend you chat with your therapist to decide what works best for you. Please book your first session within three months of receiving your access code.",
      "faqTitle4": "Can I do the sessions in-person?",
      "faqBody4": "All sessions will be held online through video calls. Bloom specialises in digital, remote support, so our therapists are experienced in getting the best out of an online session.",
      "faqTitle5": "What happens if I can't make it to my therapy session?",
      "faqBody5": "Use the link in your confirmation email to reschedule your therapy session, with as much notice as possible. Cancelling with less than 48 hours notice may count towards one of your therapy sessions, so please try to make sure you reschedule in advance.",
      "faqTitle6": "What if I can’t find a therapy slot that suits me?",
      "faqBody6": "We are just getting started with this programme of support and that means we don’t have a full team of therapists available yet. We should have availability across most time zones. But if you still can’t find a time that works, please let us know via our contact form. This will allow us to address any gaps or barriers to access, accordingly.",
      "faqTitle7": "What if I don't get along with the therapist?",
      "faqBody7": "We're all human, so don't worry if you didn't click with the therapist you spoke to. You're free to book your next session with a different therapist.",
      "faqTitle8": "What happens when my six sessions are up?",
      "faqBody8": "Have a discussion with your therapist about whether they think you could benefit from more sessions. Our therapists can share their prices with you, and you can decide whether to continue with them.",
      "faqTitle9": "I didn't go to therapy, but the platform shows I have one less session?",
      "faqBody9": "Our therapists hold slots for you, so we want to respect their time. If you didn't attend your therapy session or cancelled/rescheduled with less than 48 hours notice, then unfortunately, that may count towards one of your sessions. If you think there’s a mistake, please let us know via our contact form.",
      "faqTitle10": "Is what I discuss during the therapy sessions private?",
      "faqBody10": "Yes. Whatever you discuss with any therapist will remain strictly private between you and the therapist. At no time will Bumble have access to this information.",
      "faqTitle11": "Is the support I access confidential?",
      "faqBody11": "Yes. Bloom is a programme run by the global charity Chayn. Any information on how many therapy sessions you access will remain strictly private. We do not share this or any personal information with Bumble or any other third party.",
      "faqTitle12": "I want to give feedback",
      "faqBody12": "We want to offer a support programme that meets Bumble users’ needs. If you have any feedback, ideas, or suggestions to help us improve, please let us know via our contact form. Thank you!"
