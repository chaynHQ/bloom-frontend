    "faqs": {
      "faqTitle0": "Who is this programme for?",
      "faqBody0": "The programme is available to any Bumble user who reports sexual abuse or assault to Bumble, regardless of your background, race, age, disability, religion or belief, sexuality, gender identity or expression, or life circumstances – we are here for you.",
      "faqTitle1": "Do I have to pay for therapy?",
      "faqBody1": "Through this programme, Bloom is offering a range of services for Bumble users healing from their experience of sexual abuse or assault. This includes free access to Bloom’s self-guided library of resources created by survivors and trauma-informed therapists, and opportunities for interactive 1:1 online chat with course facilitators. For Bumble users who have had deeply traumatic experiences, six 50-minute therapy sessions will be provided at no cost to the individual.",
      "faqTitle2": "How many therapy sessions do I get?",
      "faqBody2": "For Bumble users who have had deeply traumatic experiences, six 50-minute therapy sessions will be provided at no cost to the individual.",
      "faqTitle3": "How much time do I have to book my therapy sessions?",
      "faqBody3": "You can choose how often you want to have your sessions, whether it's once a week or once a month. It is recommended you chat with your therapist to decide what works best for you. Please book your first session within three months of receiving your access code.",
      "faqTitle4": "Can I do the sessions in-person?",
      "faqBody4": "All sessions will be held online through video calls. Bloom specialises in digital, remote support. These therapists are chosen given their experience and skill for getting the best out of an online session.",
      "faqTitle5": "What happens if I can't make it to my therapy session?",
      "faqBody5": "Use the link in your confirmation email to reschedule your therapy session, with as much notice as possible. Cancelling with less than 48 hours notice may count towards one of your therapy sessions, so please try to make sure you reschedule in advance.",
      "faqTitle6": "What if I can’t find a therapy slot that suits me?",
      "faqBody6": "The Bloom partnership with Bumble and programme of support is in the early stages of getting started and that means we may not readily have a full team of therapists available yet. We should have availability across most time zones to meet your needs. If you  cannot find a therapist or a time that works, please let us know via our <faqLink>contact form</faqLink>. This will allow us to address any gaps or barriers to access, accordingly.",
      "faqTitle7": "What if I don't get along with the therapist?",
      "faqBody7": "We're all human, so don't worry if you didn't click with the therapist you spoke to. You can book your remaining session(s) with a different therapist.",
      "faqTitle8": "What happens when my six sessions are up?",
      "faqBody8": "Have a discussion with your therapist about what your needs are and whether they think you could benefit from more sessions. Bloom therapists can share their price listing with you, and you can decide whether to continue on with them.",
      "faqTitle9": "I didn't go to therapy, but the platform shows I have one less session?",
      "faqBody9": "Our therapists hold slots for you, so we want to respect their time. If you didn't attend your therapy session or cancelled/rescheduled with less than 48 hours notice, then unfortunately, that may count towards one of your sessions. If you think there’s a mistake, please send a message via our <faqLink>contact form</faqLink>.",
      "faqTitle10": "Is what I discuss during the therapy sessions private?",
      "faqBody10": "Yes. Whatever you discuss with any therapist will remain strictly private between you and the therapist. At no time will Bumble have access to this information.",
      "faqTitle11": "Is the support I access confidential?",
      "faqBody11": "Yes. Bloom is a programme run by the global charity Chayn. Any information on how many therapy sessions you access will remain strictly private. Chayn does not share this or any personal information with Bumble or any other third party.",
      "faqTitle12": "I want to give feedback",
      "faqBody12": "Bloom wants to offer a trauma support programme that meets Bumble users’ needs. If you have any feedback, ideas, or suggestions to help us improve, please let us know via this <faqLink>contact form</faqLink>. Thank you!"
