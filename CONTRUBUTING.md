# Welcome to Bloom contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! 

Read our [Code of Conduct]([./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://www.notion.so/Code-of-Conduct-7b82ae6d100940ccbdac55c2ceec8644)) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the project's [README](README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)
- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)


## Getting started

To navigate our codebase with confidence, see [this volunteer wiki]([/contributing/working-in-docs-repository.md](https://chayn.notion.site/Tech-volunteer-wiki-5356c7118c134863a2e092e9df6cbc34))  to get an idea of what kind of help we're looking for :confetti_ball:.

Make sure you have been added to the `tech-volunteers` slack channel - you can ping any questions you have in this channel! If you haven't been added to slack, please message the <a href="mailto:tech@chayn.co">team</a> and we can add you. 

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue. 

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. 

Labels can help you find an issue you'd like to help with.
- The `good first issue` label is for problems or updates we think are ideal for beginners.
- The `moderate` label is for problems or updates that may take 1-2 days and will require some knowledge of the codebase. 
- The `advanced` is for problems or updates that may take more time, say around 2-4 days. These will require more in-depth knowledge of the codebase. 

We suggest starting with a `good first issue` to get comfortable with the codebase before moving on. 

As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes in the UI

Click **Make a contribution** at the bottom of any docs page to make small changes such as a typo, sentence fix, or a broken link. This takes you to the `.md` file where you can make your changes and [create a pull request](#pull-request) for a review. 

#### Make changes in a codespace

For more information about using a codespace for working on GitHub documentation, see "[Working in a codespace](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/contributing/codespace.md)."

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them:zap:.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Please write a brief description of your PR and the problem it's solved. This helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request. 
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a Chayn tech team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada: The Chayn team thanks you :sparkles:. 

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on Github.
